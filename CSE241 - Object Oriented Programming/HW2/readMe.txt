AT FIRST, I MADE A BOT JUST GOES DOWNWARDS AND IT WAS ALWAYS LOSING. SO I ADDED SOME FEATURES BUT IT MADE MY CODE LOOK A BIT COMPLICATED.

SO HERE IS MY BOT'S PRIORITY ORDER:

1)STARTS FROM A RANDOM LOCATION AT TOP.

2) IT TRIES TO GO DOWNWARDS - LEFTDOWN IN ORDER.

3)IF IT CAN'T DO BOTH IT BLOCKS THE PLAYER

4)AFTER IT BLOCKS THE PLAYER IT GOES DOWNWARDS FIRST. THEN GOES BACK TO THE PLACE WHICH IT BLOCKED PLAYER AND STARTS TO GO UPWARDS.

5) IF IT IS NOT ABLE TO DO THE THINGS LISTED ABOVE IT TRIES TO GO RIGHT-LEFT-UPRIGHT-UP IN ORDER.

6) LASTLY, IF IT CANT DO ANYTHING, PLAYS TO A RANDOM LOCATION AND PROCEEDS FROM THERE.

THERE IS NO PROBLEM OTHER THEN MY CODE BEING TOO COMPLICATED. EVERY FEATURE WORKS.
