1) AT C PROGRAM, you should change the usb port.
my port name is ttyUSB0 so I wrote to the 9. line of the c program:
int myPort = serialport_init("/dev/ttyUSB0", 9600);
you should change this.

2) AT UBUNTU, you should give permission to use the port.
my port name is ttyUSB0 so I wrote to the terminal:
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyUSB0

3) At fourth option, arduino doesn't gets the second input so after second input,
output comes after next input. There is no reason for that, I searched and couldn't
find anything.
