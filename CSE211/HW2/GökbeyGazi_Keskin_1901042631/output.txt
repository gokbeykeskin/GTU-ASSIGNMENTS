n
(a,a)(a,b)(a,e)(b,b)(b,e)(c,c)(c,d)(d,d)(e,e)
Reflexive: Yes, because all elements are present. 
Symmetric: No, because(b,a) is not present. 
Anti-Symmetric: Yes, because (c,d) is found, but (d,c) is not found.
Transitive: Yes,because (a,e) is found since (a,b) and (b,e) are found.

n

Reflexive: No, because (e,e) is not present.
Symmetric: Yes, because (d,c) and (c,d) are present.
Anti-Symmetric: No, because (b,a) is present. 
Transitive: Yes,because (d,d) is found since (d,c) and (c,d) are found.

n
(a,a)(b,b)(c,c)(d,d)(e,e)
Reflexive: Yes, because all elements are present. 
 Symmetric: Yes, because there is no different elements. 
Anti-Symmetric: Yes, because there is no different elements.
Transitive: Yes, because there is no {a,b} , {b,c} which a!=c
