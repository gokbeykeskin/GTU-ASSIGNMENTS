\homework{Homework \#3}{Due: 04/01/21}{Dr. Zafeirakis Zafeirakopoulos}{Gizem S\"ung\"u}{}{}
\textbf{Course Policy}: Read all the instructions below carefully before you start working on the assignment, and before you make a submission.
\begin{itemize}
\item It is not a group homework. Do not share your answers to anyone in any circumstance. Any cheating means at least -100 for both sides. 
\item Do not take any information from Internet.
\item No late homework will be accepted. 
\item For any questions about the homework, send an email to gizemsungu@gtu.edu.tr
\item The homeworks (both latex and pdf files in a zip file) will be
submitted into the course page of Moodle.
\item The latex, pdf and zip files of the homeworks should be saved as
"Name\_Surname\_StudentId".$\{$tex, pdf, zip$\}$.
\item If the answers of the homeworks have only calculations without any formula or any explanation -when needed- will get zero.
\item Writing the homeworks on Latex is strongly suggested. However, hand-written paper is still accepted $\textbf{IFF}$ hand writing of the student is clear and understandable to read, and the paper is well-organized. Otherwise, the assistant cannot grade the student's homework.
\end{itemize}

\problem{1: Representing Graphs}{10}
Represent the graph in Figure \ref{fig:graph1} with an adjacency matrix. Explain your representation clearly.

Determine whether there is a Hamilton circuit for each given graph (See Figure \ref{fig:G1a}, Figure \ref{fig:G1b}, Figure \ref{fig:G1c} ). If the graph has a Hamilton circuit, show the path with its vertices which gives a Hamilton circuit. If it does not, explain why no Hamilton circuit exists. \newline

\problem{4: Applications for Hasse Diagram of Relations}{40}
Remember the Problem 3 in Homework 2. 
\newline
\newline
Write an algorithm to draw Hasse diagram of the given relations in "input.txt" which is given for HW2.
\newline
\newline
Your code should meet the following requirements, standards and accomplish the given tasks.


\begin{itemize}
	\item Read the relations from the text file "input.txt". You can use your code from HW2 if you implemented to read the file. If you didn't implement it, please check HW2 to learn how to read the relations from the file. 
	\item Determine each relation in "input.txt" whether it is reflexive, symmetric, anti-symmetric and transitive with your algorithm from HW2.
	\item In order to draw Hasse diagram, each relation must be POSET. Hence, the relation obeys the following rules:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Reflexivity
		\item Anti-symmetric
		\item Transitivity 
	\end{itemize}
	If the relation is not a POSET, your algorithm is responsible to CONVERT it to POSET. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the relation is not reflexive, add new pairs to make the relation reflexive.
		\item If the relation is symmetric, remove some pairs which make the relation symmetric. For instance, if the relation has (a, b) and (b, a), remove one of them randomly.
		\item If the relation is not transitive, add new pairs which would make the relation transitive. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item After the relation becomes POSET, your algorithm should obtain Hasse diagram of the relation and write the diagram with the following format. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An example of the output format is given in "exampleoutput.txt". The file has the result of the first relation in "input.txt".
		\item In "output.txt", each new Hasse diagram starts with "n".
		\item The relation is (a, a), (a, b), (a, e), (b, b), (b, e), (c, c), (c, d), (d, d), (e, e)
		\item The relation is already a POSET so we don't need to add or remove any pairs.
		\item After "n", write the POSET in the next line as it is shown in "exampleoutput.txt".
		\item Since the relation is POSET, it becomes (a, b), (b, e), (c, d) after removing reflexive and transitive pairs. 
		\item The following lines give each pair of Hasse diagram.
	\end{itemize}	
	\item You can implement your algorithm in Python, Java, C or C++.
	\item $\textbf{Important: }$ Put comments almost for each line of your code to describe what the line is going to do. 
	\item You should put your source code file (file name is problem1.$\{.c, .java, .py, .cpp\}$) and output.txt into your homework zip file (check Course Policy).
\end{itemize}
